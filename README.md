# Technical Assessment - Digital Product Team

We invite you to build a Single Page Application (SPA) that evaluates and displays statistics for uploaded text (.txt) files. Use modern JavaScript or TypeScript and any frameworks or tools you're comfortable with.

## Objective
Develop an application that can calculate and display the following statistics for a given text file:

1. **Whitespace-delimited Word Count** - Total number of words separated by spaces.
2. **Line Count** - Total number of lines in the text.
3. **Most Common Letter** - The letter that appears most frequently in the text.
4. **Letters per Word**:
   - **Mean** (rounded to one decimal place).
   - **Mode**.
   - **Median**.

## Guidelines

- Ensure the application runs in a browser (we'll use Chrome)
- We value code structure, readability, testability, and performance
- Prioritize functionality over aesthetics. The interface should show consideration of UX but doesn't need to be polished
- Feel free to omit a database or other method of storing statistics, if you wish
- There's no need for user authentication.


## Deliverables

1. Create a private GitHub repository.
2. Once your solution is ready, share repository access with [junkaneko@riverford.co.uk](mailto:junkaneko@riverford.co.uk) and [ianboucher@riverford.co.uk](mailto:junkaneko@riverford.co.uk).
3. Include a clear set of instructions for building and running your application.

## Assessment Criteria

- **Accuracy**: Ensure your application provides correct results.
- **Code Quality**: Focus on structure, readability, and extendability.
- **Performance**: Test against a diverse set of inputs to ensure robustness.
- **Testability**: We'd love to see how you'd test the application.

## Timeframe
Please submit your solution ~24hrs prior to your scheduled interview (or sooner) to give us time to review your solution. We're not expecting an exhaustively developed application - we're more interested in your approach than your available free-time.
