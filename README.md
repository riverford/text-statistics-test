# Technical Test
We would like you to build an SPA that calculates statistics about text files submitted to it and displays those statistics in a useful form. The solution should be built using modern JavaScript or TypeScript.

## Required Statistics
- Whitespace delimited word count
- Line count
- Mean(to 1decimal place), mode and median letters per word
- Most common letter

## Deliverables
Create a private GitHub repository and share access to it by emailing richardturner@riverford.co.uk. Your solution must include instructions on how to build and run the application.

## Hints
We will be looking at the accuracy of the your results, code style and readability, its performance against a range of inputs and how easy the code is to extend to additional statistics.

## Timeframe
Please return your submission within 5 working days. You can spend as long or as little as you wish on the test, the solution & approach is more interesting to us than your available free-time. Once received we will review the solution and, should the solution meet the required standard, organise for further interview steps.
